# crop-recommendation-system-using-data-analytics
Crop Recommendation System Using Data Analytics is implemented using Python that uses
Machine Learning techniques in order to predict the most profitable crop in the forecasted weather
and soil conditions at a specified location. To receive the most profitable predictions the proposed
website requests the user to fill up some obligatory details for the prediction. Once you are a member
of the website you are requested to fill your current location and month, further based on your input
the website will predict the most suitable crop according to the weather, soil conditions. You can see
a page that will display the most suitable crop based on your input, as well as you will receive the
same as a notification on your registered Email-Id account from the system.
The most profitable crop is predicted using Multiple Linear Regression (MLR). It is a statistical
technique that uses several explanatory variables to predict the outcome of a response variable. It is a
function that allows an analyst or statistician to make predictions about one variable based on the
information that is known about another variable.
